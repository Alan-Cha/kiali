== Installing Istio and BookInfo Demo

These scripts can be used to deploy http://istio.io[Istio] and its https://istio.io/docs/guides/bookinfo.html[BookInfo] demo on either OpenShift or Kubernetes.

[NOTE]
Use of these scripts is not required. They are provided only as a convenience. You can decide to install Istio in whatever way you choose. These scripts only illustrate one way to do this.

=== OpenShift

In the link:./openshift[] folder you will find scripts to install Istio and the BookInfo demo on OpenShift.

A typical set of commands issued to get everything up and running on a locally built OpenShift Origin node is:

```
./hack/cluster-openshift.sh up
oc login
./hack/istio/openshift/istio-install-openshift.sh
./hack/istio/openshift/istio-bookinfo-openshift.sh
make build docker openshift-deploy
```

=== Kubernetes

In the link:./kubernetes[] folder you will find scripts to install Istio and the BookInfo demo on Kubernetes.

A typical set of commands issued to get everything up and running on minikube is:

```
minikube start
./hack/istio/kubernetes/istio-install-kubernetes.sh
./hack/istio/kubernetes/istio-bookinfo-kubernetes.sh
make build minikube-docker k8s-deploy
```
